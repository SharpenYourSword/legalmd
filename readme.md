# LegalMarkdownJS

Inspired by the ruby gem built by @compleatang, I wanted to build a javascript port of `Legal Markdown`. 

Check out the demo at [http://code.esq.io/legalmd](http://code.esq.io/legalmd)

# Contributing

To help make development easy and the user-experience seamless, I am using [reactjs](http://facebook.github.io/react/) to develop the application. It has a slight learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty sweet.
